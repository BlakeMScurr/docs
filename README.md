CodeLingo Docs

This repo generates a static HTML site from markdown. Docs for the different versions are organised by branch. The master branch is SaaS, which all other branches should keep up-to-date with. The lex-sdk and bot-sdk branches are merged with the onprem branch at the point of deploying the platform for a client who has those licences.

See here to run the site: http://www.mkdocs.org

Documentation on the individual repositories should be kept in sync with this repo. We should look to automate this in the future.

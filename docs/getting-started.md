# Getting Started

## Introduction

There are two ways to leverage CodeLingo Actions to automate your workflows, the [CodeLingo Dashboard](https://www.codelingo.io/dashboard) and the [CodeLingo GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/codelingo). Here we will see how to use these tool with an example.

## CodeLingo Dashboard

To use the CodeLingo Dashboard you must first be a GitHub user or organization and have at least on public GitHub Repository.

Integrating Specs into your existing developer workflow is done through Actions. The simplest Action to get started with is the Review Action. To try it for yourself, navigate to the CodeLingo [dashboard](https://www.codelingo.io/dashboard) and follow the tutorial.

Note: The Review Action only supports public repos at this time.

Once configured, the Review Action will comment on pull requests that violate a Spec.

The Review Action will only review Pull Requests and will never make changes to your codebase.

Actions can be used to build any custom workflow. Whether that's generating custom reports on your project dashboard, or integrations with your existing tools and services through Functions.

If you are interested in building custom Actions and integrations, please contact us directly at:

## Next Steps

Now that you have basic integration with CodeLingo into your project, you can start to add additional Specs and build custom workflow augmentation.

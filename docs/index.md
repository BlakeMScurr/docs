## Tenets

The CodeLingo platform is based on a key concept of Tenets. Tenets are patterns and heurestics that you apply to your software stack in the formed of stored queries. CLQL is the language used to write these queries, and is what allows you to treat you software stack as data.

**[Explore existing tenets](url)**

Tenets can be written for:

* Source code - Abstract Syntax Tree
* Version Control
* Runtime

Tenets can detect and manage patterns in: Best Practices,  Coding Style, Peformance, Security Vulnerabilities, Debugging, Gotchas, Complexity, Churn

**[Guide to working with Tenets](concepts/tenets.md)**



## Flows
Flows automate common developer workflows.

Flows can be configured directly in YAML or via the Flow Composer GUI. This allows you to build custom worktflows with your tenets, and integrations with your existing tools through Bots.

Build custom debug dashboards, crash reports, code review UIs and monitoring systems.

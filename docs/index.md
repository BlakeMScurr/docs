## Overview
The CodeLingo platform guides software teams to build better code, faster. CodeLingo integrates with the unique workflows and existing tooling of software development teams.

## Getting started

To get started with CodeLingo, you will first need to [create an account](https://codelingo.io/join)

For installation, and getting setup with the CLI tool and pull request integration, please see the getting started guide.

**[View getting started guide](getting-started.md)**

The CodeLingo platform is based on the key concepts of Lexicons, Tenets, Bots and Flows. These can be used for deep analysis of code quality of the entire software stack, and augmentation of the software development lifecycle.

## Lexicons

Lexicons provide the language to describe patterns across all different domains of the SDLC in the form of a library of facts. Think of them of as a DSL for specific domains for define patterns and heuristics. There are Lexicons for:

- Software languages (Golang, C#, C++, PHP, Python etc)
- Version Control Systems (Git, Perforce, Subversion)
- Runtime

## Tenets

Tenets are the patterns and heuristics that you apply to your software stack in the form of stored queries. CLQL is the language used to write these queries. It is what allows you to treat you software stack as data, and requires the use of domain specific Lexicons.

Tenets can detect and manage patterns in: Best Practices, Coding Style, Performance, Security Vulnerabilities, Debugging, Gotchas, Complexity, Churn, and more.

## Bots
Bots are agents that integrate with your infrastructure. They can either be used to extract particular Tenets from your software stack, or push results to different tools that you use. Bots are core to building Flows and are used to integrate your analysis from Tenets.


## Flows
Flows automate and augment common developer workflows. In the context of Tenets, they can be used to fail builds, comment on pull requests, send error notifications, or expose dashboarding.

Flows can be configured directly in YAML or via the Flow Composer GUI. This allows you to build custom workflows with your tenets, and integrations with your existing tools through Bots.

Build custom debug dashboards, crash reports, code review UIs, and monitoring systems.

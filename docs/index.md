## Overview
The CodeLingo platform guide's software teams to build better code, faster. CodeLingo integrates with the unique workflows and existing tooling of software development teams.

## Getting started

For installation, and getting setup with the CLI tool and pull request integration, please see the getting started guide. 

**[View getting started guide](getting-started.md)**

## Tenets

The CodeLingo platform is based on a key concept of Tenets. Tenets are patterns and heuristics that you apply to your software stack in the form of stored queries. CLQL is the language used to write these queries, and is what allows you to treat you software stack as data.

Tenets can be written for:

* Source code - Abstract Syntax Tree
* Version Control
* Runtime

Tenets can detect and manage patterns in: Best Practices,  Coding Style, Performance, Security Vulnerabilities, Debugging, Gotchas, Complexity, Churn

## Flows
Flows automate common developer workflows.

Flows can be configured directly in YAML or via the Flow Composer GUI. This allows you to build custom workflows with your tenets, and integrations with your existing tools through Bots.

Build custom debug dashboards, crash reports, code review UIs and monitoring systems.

CodeLingo currently supports:

* Automated code review comments
* Build integration
* Alerting
